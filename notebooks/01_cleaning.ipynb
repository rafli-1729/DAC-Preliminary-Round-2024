    "This notebook presents a full inspection and preprocessing pipeline for the raw dataset provided by the DAC PRS ITS 2024 Preliminary Round competition. The dataset is originally distributed in a fragmented structure, where the training labels, weather information, metadata, and multi-year solar irradiance files are kept separate. Before constructing any predictive model, these sources need to be explored, validated, and merged into a consistent framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition's target variable is **% Baseline**, defined as *the percentage of energy generated within one hour relative to the total energy storage capacity*. Since the train and test files contain only timestamps and baseline values, we must incorporate additional contextual features from the supporting datasets in order to build meaningful predictive models. This notebook guides the full process of inspecting the raw inputs and preparing them for downstream modeling."

It measures incoming solar power per unit area and directly affects the system's ability to produce baseline energy.

Incorporating irradiance signals allows the predictive model to capture high-resolution energy-related fluctuations that are not visible in the timestamp alone.\n",

This confirms that the missingness originates from natural astronomical conditions rather than data corruption. These missing values are therefore valid and expected, and can be handled appropriately during modeling depending on whether the presence or absence of these events carries predictive significance."

The insights from EDA will guide decisions on cleaning—such as handling missing values, smoothing irregular measurements, or addressing outliers—and inform our feature engineering strategy. Moving forward, we will extract meaningful temporal features, evaluate irradiance and weather-derived signals, and generate additional predictors that enhance the model’s ability to learn energy generation behavior."
