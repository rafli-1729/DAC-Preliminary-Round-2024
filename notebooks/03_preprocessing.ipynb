It first extends sys.path to allow importing project modules, then suppresses warnings to keep the notebook clean. Core tools such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `Pathlib`, and the `KMeans` clustering algorithm are imported, along with the custom preprocessing utilities from src.preprocessing. A small reload helper is defined to streamline development when updating the module. The notebook then sets standardized paths to the processed train and test files, including the engineered versions that will be created later. A final message confirms that all libraries and configuration steps are ready."

Unlike simple mean or median replacement, KNN considers the relationships between multiple features and imputes missing values based on the nearest valid observations in the feature space. This allows the imputed values to better reflect realistic atmospheric conditions instead of producing overly generic or biased estimates.
